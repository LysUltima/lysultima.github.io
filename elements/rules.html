<h3>Elements!</h3>
<p>Rules:</p>
<p>There are four elements you can use, Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. Each element has a different effect, which can change depending on the element used by your opponent. Earth is hardened by Fire, gaining 1 life if the opponent uses Fire. However, it is eroded by Water, making it lose 1 life. Water heals yourself, making you gain 1 life. However, the raging heat of Fire will evaporate it, making the you lose 4 lives. Air makes you lose 1 life from its chaotic nature, but if the opponent uses Fire, the opponent loses 3 lives instead from the fire being blown back. You cannot use the same element twice in a row. You start with 10 lives, and the first player to get to 0 loses. If both players are below 0, the one with the highest amount of lives wins. If their lives are the same, it is a tie.</p>
